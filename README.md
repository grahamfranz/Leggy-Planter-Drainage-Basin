# Leggy-Planter-Drainage-Basin
A drainage basin for the leggy planter 3d printed model.

  This is my addition to the leggy planter by [p4zr](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2677108). It is a drainage basin to go underneath. While p4zr did provide a drainage hole, it is not good for indoors as the water would get everywhere. This basin gives it a place to go without ruining the shape of the planter. It costs about 10c to print and takes an hour.
